			<div class="one border_project">printf
				<!-- discription -->
				<p>
					The ft_printf project at 42 challenges students to
					recreate the C printf() function,
					handling format specifiers like %d, %s, %x, %X, and %p.
					It teaches variadic functions, string manipulation,
					and proper memory management,
					preparing students for more advanced coding tasks.

			<div class="two border_project">get_next_line
				<p>
					The get_next_line project at 42 requires students to implement a
					function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one at a time,
					until the end of the file. The challenge lies in handling dynamic
					memory allocation, managing buffers efficiently, and dealing with
					edge cases like line breaks or incomplete reads. This project sharpens
					skills in file I/O, memory management, and working with static variables,
					making it a fundamental exercise in developing efficient and reliable code.

			<div class="three border_project">Push_swap
				<p>
					The push_swap project at 42 tasks students with sorting a stack of numbers
					using two stacks and a limited set of operations. The goal is to sort the
					stack in as few moves as possible, which requires careful algorithm selection
					and optimization. This project helps students develop a deeper understanding of
					sorting algorithms, data structures (like stacks), and problem-solving strategies,
					as well as writing efficient and optimized code.

			<div class="four border_project">so_long
				<p>
					The so_long project at 42 challenges students to create a simple 2D game using
					the MiniLibX graphical library. The objective is to navigate a character through
					a map while collecting items and reaching an exit, all while handling map validation,
					movement logic, and rendering. This project helps students practice game development basics,
					working with 2D grids, event handling, and using graphics libraries, while reinforcing
					problem-solving and coding efficiency.

			<div class="five border_project">Philosophers
				<p>
					The philosophers project at 42 challenges students to solve the classic "dining philosophers"
					problem using multithreading. The task involves simulating philosophers who alternate between
					eating, thinking, and sleeping, while managing shared resources (forks) without causing deadlocks
					or race conditions. This project teaches concurrency, thread synchronization, and how to avoid
					common pitfalls in parallel programming, providing a solid foundation for understanding multithreading
					and process management.

			<div class="six border_project">Minishell
				<p>
					The minishell project at 42 requires students to build a simple Unix shell that can execute commands,
					handle pipes, redirections, and environment variables. The goal is to implement essential shell features
					like command parsing, process creation, and signal handling. This project teaches the fundamentals
					of system calls, process control, and input/output management, giving students a deeper understanding
					of how shells work and strengthening their ability to work with low-level programming in C.
